## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Mainly I used flexbox to organize all the layout, I still don't know if it is responsive or not. It was hard to size all.

### Continued development

I want to learn to adapt the layout to different sizes.
